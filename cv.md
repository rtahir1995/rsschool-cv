## About me

I am from [Azerbaijan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azerbaijan). I live in [Baku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baku). I really like to travel. In order to travel a lot, I needed to find a profession that would not require constant presence in the office. So I decided to become a full stack developer.  I've loved creating websites since I was a kid. I used to make websites on different website builders, such as ucoz. Now I hope to develop websites of a more professional level.

## Code examples

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    <p>This is my first HTML page.</p>
</body>
</html>
```
I had no work experience. I was just trying to write codes from the courses I studied.
